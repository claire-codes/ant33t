# ant33t.rocks

Source code for a little app I wrote for Ant's birthday. Live at [ant3t.rocks](http://ant33t.rocks/).

## Local development

`npm start` will run a serve on `localhost:9999`.

Build the CSS with `npm run build-css`.

## Notes

I used CSS Grid which is dead new, and yet I wrote JavaScript in ES5 for compaitibility 🤷‍♀️
